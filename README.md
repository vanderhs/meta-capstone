# Capstone Project: Little Lemon Restaurant Booking App

Welcome to my capstone project repository for the Meta Front-End Developer Professional Certificate. This project represents the culmination of my learning journey, where I applied the concepts and skills acquired throughout the course to build a web application for the Little Lemon restaurant.

## Project Overview

In this capstone project, I developed a web application designed for managing table bookings at the Little Lemon restaurant. The application is built using React, showcasing my ability to create interactive and user-friendly front-end solutions. The main focus of this project was to design and implement a form for handling table reservations.

### Key Features

- **Table Booking Form:** Allows users to select a date, time, and number of guests to make a reservation.
- **Validation and Error Handling:** Ensures that all required fields are filled out correctly before submission.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for various devices, providing a seamless user experience across different screen sizes.
- **Dynamic Updates:** Real-time updates and feedback as users interact with the form.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** For building the user interface and managing state.
- **HTML5:** For structuring the content.
- **CSS3:** For styling and responsive design.
- **JavaScript:** For form validation and dynamic behavior.
